Summary of game’s story, focusing on gameplay

A young boy genius searches for scattered parts of his broken dimensional travelling machine so he can get back to his own reality.
The intended published version would have wacky weird levels inspired by Super Mario Bros. 3! Instead of having 8 worlds and X amount of sub-levels, the levels will be structured like Metroid or Castlevania requiring the player to return to locked areas after obtaining an ability to allow access. New dimensions rather than varying worlds will be the theme allowing creative freedom with wacky level designs and future mechanics i.e. reversed controls, 
<What is the backstory to your game?  I hope the bad guy hasn’t kidnapped your girl!!!!  Having a deep, coherent backstory can help ground all of the elements of the game>

Intended systems

Jumping/Platforming, Flying, Shooting, Enemy AI, Boss AI, Score System, Timer, Menu and Collectible Objectives.
The level design will be structured with platform traversing in mind. Enemy AI will act as obstacles and a Boss AI at the end of the level. The player will be able to pick up flying and shooting power ups to help get through the level and there will also be collectables for bonus objectives.

2-3 similar games

Super Mario Bros. 3 – the level design and renowned precise platform controls is the main inspiration for this game. The desired published version would have wacky, weird, colourful and fun universes drawn from the various world types in SMB3.
Metroid – the published version would ideally have a very open side scrolling levels with locked areas that requires the player to return after visiting another point, midway through the game.
<Even the most unique and unusual games have similarities with existing games, even if the similarity is only how unusual the game is!  What games are most similar to this game.  Listing the specific features where appropriate>

Unique selling points

Nostalgia for the NES and SMB fans. The unique various ‘dimensions’ level design, basic controls, combat & objectives, clever level design and Metroid-Vania style will be the game’s strongest points.
<Is this game doing something that no other game has done before?  Is this game combining known features in a unique way?>

What’s enjoyable/positive about this game?

Simple but challenging level design that increases in difficulty as the game progresses. Platforming helps train dexterity, AI enemies for strategic approaches towards progression and secret collectables/power ups hidden in the game.
